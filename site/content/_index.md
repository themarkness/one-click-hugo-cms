blurb:
  heading: About me
  text: I am an accredited integrative counsellor offering individual and couple
    therapy in South East London. I draw on different theories and ideas in my
    work. Counselling can give you a safe space to explore the difficult and
    painful elements of your life to try and make more sense of them and work
    towards change. Whatever troubles you are facing, I will try and support you
    to reach a place where life feels more settled and meaningful. I work to a
    strict code of ethics and abide by the BACP's Ethical Framework, for whom I
    am an accredited and registered member. I have over 10 years' experience of
    working with a variety of services and people from all different
    backgrounds. I am also accredited with the Foundation for Infant Loss

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
